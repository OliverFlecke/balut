# Balut on the web

A small front-end version of the [Balut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balut_(game)) game!

## Development

Requires Node v16 (or maybe newer).

Install dependencies with `npm install`.
Run the application locally on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with `npm start`.

## Deployment

Deployment can be done from the CLI with `npm deploy`. This will build the application into static assets and push them on the `gh-pages` branch. This branch can then be hosted anywhere.
